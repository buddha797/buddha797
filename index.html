              <p class="mb-5">As president, I will make College Council the most transparent organization on campus.  With a budget of about four hundred thousand dollars, the student body deserves to know where their money is going.  At Oxford I created our first transparency requirements.   I will build on this experience to create and publish an annual budget report so that the student body can see how their money is being spent.
                <br><br>
                As president, I will hold office hours every week, and make myself available to any student.  I will also use Zoom Video Chat to provide access to students who cannot attend in person.  Furthermore, I will ensure that College Council has a table every single week at Wonderful Wednesday to listen to the concerns of the student body.
                <br><br>
                We will create a new website, working with LITS to get a domain name such as collegecouncil.emory.edu.  No student government within Emory has been capable of creating a working webpage in years, so clearly a new system is necessary.  I will create a Vice President of Technology, who will be responsible for overseeing the webpage, internal communication tools such as Slack, and make sure that College Council is using every tool at our disposal to keep the student body informed.  We will use social media and our webpage to publish our minutes every week and livestream legislative meetings.  With all of these tools at our disposal we will make the 64th College Council the most transparent since its creation in 1955.  For far too long College Council has not been open to the student body, and rebuilding our relationship starts with complete transparency.

                <h2 class="text-secondary text-uppercase mb-4">Representation</h2>
              <p class="mb-5">It is time for College Council to rethink our relationship with student organizations, and work to ensure that the needs every student is represented.  College Council should represent every single student in Emory College by expanding the role of student organizations and expanding student representation.  Furthermore, I will reintroduce positions for students intending to enter the Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing or the Goizueta Business School.  With so many students in Emory College planning to enter these schools, it’s time to build these relationships and ensure these students are represented in College Council.
                <br><br>
                Furthermore, as President I would create a Student Advocacy Center, to provide advice to any student facing conduct violations, honor code violations, academic appeals, or who simply needs help navigating Emory’s bureaucracy.  This center will ensure that the rights of every student in Emory College are respected.
                <br><br>
                Student organizations are not just groups in need of funding, and we should stop thinking of them as such.  As many student governments across the nation have done, I will create representation for student groups.  From cultural groups to political groups to special interest groups, Emory students come together to create a diverse range of student organizations.  These groups represent a diverse student body better than one student government ever could.  As president I will create a representation for student organizations, comprised of club representatives.  We will organize clubs with similar missions, allowing them to work together on programming more effectively, and send representation to College Council, so that they can voice the concerns of their organizations and communities.  This will help us reimagine College Council and help us become the most representative organization on campus.

              <h2 class="text-secondary text-uppercase mb-4">Responsiveness</h2>
              <p class="mb-5">As president, I will ensure that College Council is the most responsive organization on campus.  We will create new structures and systems to directly respond to the concerns of students in Emory College.  Beyond our transparency reforms, we will build a committee structure that allows us to respond to concerns across a variety of campus issues and inform the student body of how we are responding to their needs.
                <br><br>
                From campus services to academics to food and more, College Council has always worked to advance the needs of students in Emory College.  However, our current system for doing so is informal, relying on the initiatives of individual legislators.  College Council legislators have made change across all aspects of campus life, but a new system is needed to make sure nothing falls through the cracks.  Of course, legislators will always be free to pursue their individual initiatives as well.
                <br><br>
                Currently, College Council’s committee structure is led by the executive board.  Committees like those led by our various Vice Presidents, do fantastic work, but elected legislators deserve a greater role in College Council.
                <br><br>
                We will create committees to respond to all aspects of student life, from Academics to Dining and more.  Most importantly, they will be led by elected student legislators and membership will be open to the student body.  Furthermore, we will create two online systems to track student concerns and initiatives.  Students will be able to submit concerns that affect individual issues through an online portal and receive updates as we act on their behalf.  Finally, we will regularly update the College Council website with an initiative tracker for issues that impact the entire student body.  Students will be able to see how their legislators are working to improve their campus.

              <p class="mb-5">One of the most important changes I will make is ensuring that College Council is a more professional organization.  College Council is filled with dedicated people, uniquely committed to improving Emory College.  However, we can keep our collegial spirit while improving the way we are organized.  As president, I will reform our executive board to be more streamlined and efficient.  Far too often we operate on precedent, and our governing documents are sorely in need of reform.  We will create a full-time secretary, separate from our VP of Communications.  This position will ensure that all records are preserved for future councils.  As president, I will lead the 64th College Council in an effort to restructure our executive board to be as efficient as possible.
                <br><br>
                Furthermore, I will create a document review committee to ensure that our constitution and bylaws are up to date.  Building on my experience leading the Constitutional Revision Committee at Oxford SGA and the Electoral Reform Commission in Emory SGA, we will clarify and update our governing documents.  Finally, we will ensure that our process for passing and implementing legislation is improved.  Presently, records are often not fully preserved, and bills are not communicated to the student body.
                <br><br>
                I will transition College Council to a new document system, managed through Emory University, that will preserve our records and make it easy to publicize them on our new website.  We will ensure that all bills are posted in advance, and that the results of all votes are published online.  Furthermore, all students in Emory College will be able to upload their own bills and resolutions to be considered by College Council.  By improving our governing documents, procedures, and meetings, we will ensure that College Council leads the way in representing the student body effectively.
